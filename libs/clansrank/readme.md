## Requests
If you are a Krunker Clan owner/administrator, please contact me via Discord: `blandrice#8363` for interest in integrating your clan ranks into this in-game display.

1. All images.png work as clan badges (but simpler is better!)
2. Admins / Recruiters can be assigned for your clan
    - Admins can give / remove your Clan's ranks from anyone
    - Recruiters can give / remove your Clan's lowest rank (member status) from anyone
3. Due to current Data Storage limitations, the current script is willing to support up to 30 different Clan rankings. https://krdocs.swatdo.ge/#data-storage
